USED PYCHARM FOR THIS PROJECT
All of the Sample Outputs are provided in the project


#1: This will take 2 lists using the insert function to add to the list and will merge them with the merge function. The printLL function is used to print the list

#2: This will create a list and using the insert function, add elements to the list. The print function will print out the elements contained in the list. The countNodes function will count the number of elements in the list and will return the value to you.

#3: This will create an empty queue, which you can add and remove elements using the dequeue and enqueue functions. The print function will allow you to print what is currently in the queue. The first function will let you know what is in the front of the queue. The rotate function will take the first element of the queue and move it to the back of the queue.

#4: This file has the get, set, remove, and add functions. These functions will remove and add to the list. The palindrome function will return True if all the indexes when reverse are equal to each other. It will return False if the list and the reverse list do not match.

#5: Import the Python library itertools and import combinations. The parisum function will take in L as a PositionalList and V as an integer. Then it will use combinations to compare every combination to the variable V and will append it to the list.
